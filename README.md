Edison Candle
=============
The Edison Candle is an example of building a production device using a
System-on-Module (SoM) running Android Things.
This repository contains the application software.

See [Application/README.md](Application/README.md) for reasons why this fork is different.

You can find the hardware schematic, layout, and bill of materials (BOM) hosted
on [CircuitHub](https://circuithub.com/projects/androidthings/edison-candle).
